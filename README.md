# SpaceDust Configs for Beyond Home 

> Version 0.1.0 By Jefftheguyperson

A set of SpaceDust configs for Beyond Home Planet Pack in Kerbal Space Program. Also adds distributions and the ability to prospect for Methane as well as removing LiquidFuel prospecting if CryoTanks is installed.

To install, place the BHSpaceDust folder in GameData.

Requirements:
- KSP v. 1.12.x
- SpaceDust
- Beyond Home
- CryoTanks (optional)
- Far Future Technologies (optional)
- Near Future Propulsion (optional)

Known Issues:
- The PT-EDW1N Telescope still has the LiquidFuel scanner module.
- XenonGas does not have definitions (Not a bug, just reality: Xenon is not a very common gas. If people want me to add Xenon configs, I'd be more than happy to.)
- Some resource definitions may have unusually large numbers of particles on the map screen.
- Lua does not have Hydrogen or Deuterium distributions.

Special Thanks:
- Squad for creating the game
- Nertea for creating SpaceDust
- GamesLinx for creating Beyond Home
